sections = {
    "Prime Minister‚Äôs Introduction": {
        "Observations": [
            "National security is now the Government‚Äôs top priority given Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine and broader global instability.",
            "Defence and economic security are closely linked: instability abroad drives up energy costs and inflation at home."
        ],
        "Recommendations": [
            "Increase defence spending to 2.5 % of GDP by 2027.",
            "Set an ambition for 3 % of GDP in the next Parliament to reverse previous force reductions and underinvestment."
        ]
    },
    "Foreword from the Secretary of State": {
        "Observations": [
            "Threat environment evolving rapidly: war in Europe, daily cyber-attacks, and heightened nuclear risks.",
            "Since the last General Election, the Government has already announced the largest sustained defence spending increase since the Cold War and delivered the biggest pay rise for Service personnel in over 20 years."
        ],
        "Recommendations": [
            "Continue external, expert-led consultation on Defence reform (e.g., submissions, industry engagement, citizens‚Äô panel).",
            "Monitor implementation of legislation like the Armed Forces Commissioner Bill to improve service life."
        ]
    },
    "Foreword from the Reviewers": {
        "Observations": [
            "Commissioned amidst Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine and growing great-power competition.",
            "Emphasis on rebuilding warfighting readiness and deterrence with integrated conventional and digital forces."
        ],
        "Recommendations": [
            "Procurement and innovation must proceed at ‚Äúwartime pace.‚Äù",
            "Aim to transition to 2.5 % of GDP (2.6 % including UKIC) by 2027 and target 3 % in the 2030s."
        ]
    },
    "1. Introduction and Overview": {
        "Observations": [
            "For the first time since the Cold War, the UK faces multiple direct threats to security, prosperity, and democratic values.",
            "High-intensity peer conflict (e.g., Russia) is again plausible; Cold War‚Äìera metrics no longer suffice."
        ],
        "Recommendations": [
            "Develop networks of crewed, uncrewed, and autonomous assets integrated by data flows.",
            "Restore home defence and resilience against sub-threshold attacks (espionage, cyber, information manipulation).",
            "Implement Defence Reform: four new portfolio areas, clearer accountability, faster decision-making, and top-down force design under Military Strategic Headquarters (MSHQ)."
        ]
    },
    "2. The Case for Transformation": {
        "Observations": [
            "There is a ‚Äúnew era of threat‚Äù: multipolar competition, rapid tech change, and daily sub-threshold attacks on the UK (espionage, cyber, economic coercion).",
            "Cold War‚Äìera posture and expeditionary-only approach no longer sufficient."
        ],
        "Recommendations": [
            "Fundamental transformation driven by Defence Reform, integrated force design, digital foundations, and joint innovation cycles.",
            "Position the UK as a tech-enabled power with an Integrated Force that deters, fights, and wins through constant ‚Äúwartime pace‚Äù innovation."
        ]
    },
    "3. Roles for UK Defence": {
        "Observations": [
            "Primary role of Armed Forces: deterrence so war is unnecessary; if deterrence fails, be prepared to fight and win.",
            "Reliance on expeditionary disruption has masked the need for home defence and credible retaliation across all domains."
        ],
        "Recommendations": [
            "Build societal resilience to withstand and recover from attacks on critical national infrastructure (CNI).",
            "Develop expanded options for retaliation: conventional, cyber, economic, informational.",
            "Nurture strategic culture and education around nuclear escalation via wargames and tabletop exercises.",
            "Strengthen intellectual base and debate: ties with academia, think tanks, and industry.",
            "Embed ‚ÄúNATO First‚Äù with interoperability roadmaps and common standards by January 2026."
        ]
    },
    "4. Transforming UK Warfighting": {
        "4.1 The Integrated Force Model": {
            "Observations": [
                "Joint operations are no longer enough; forces must be integrated from the top down under CDS at MSHQ.",
                "Integrated Force requires a single force design blending nuclear, conventional, and Special Forces, with common enablers delivered under one scheme."
            ],
            "Recommendations": [
                "Invert authority so design/readiness flows top-down rather than through Service stovepipes.",
                "Prioritise networked, software-defined capabilities (crewed/uncrewed, manned/unmanned teaming, AI).",
                "Build a common digital foundation and Digital Targeting Web for faster decision-making and distributed lethality.",
                "Interim: consolidate ‚ÄúUnderstand‚Äù and ‚ÄúStrike‚Äù at Cabinet sub-committee; create CyberEM Command by end 2025; empower Defence Intelligence under a new charter; sprint review to rebuild medical services; deliver Defence Infrastructure Recapitalisation Plan by Feb 2026."
            ]
        },
        "4.2 Innovation and Industry: A New Approach for Deterrence and Growth": {
            "Observations": [
                "Defence must harness purchasing power as a first customer to seed deep tech (AI, autonomy, quantum, space).",
                "2023/24 MOD R&D spend was ¬£2.6 bn‚Äîneeds alignment with DSIT, UKRI, ARIA, and private sector."
            ],
            "Recommendations": [
                "Unlock private capital via funding models and regional clusters (e.g., cyber in Manchester, AI in Northeast, marine autonomy in Plymouth).",
                "Radical procurement reform: delegate authority to National Armaments Director Group, adopt an always-on munitions pipeline, embed UK export objectives.",
                "Create Defence Industrial Strategy co-chaired by Defence Secretary and Chancellor, plus a Defence Growth Board.",
                "Transfer UK Defence & Security Exports to MOD; establish export licensing review; embed metrics for lethality, productivity, and economic impact."
            ]
        },
        "4.3 ‚ÄòOne Defence‚Äô: People, Training, and Education": {
            "Observations": [
                "People are a critical enabler: recruitment, retention, and training must support an Integrated Force.",
                "Existing training pipelines are siloed, and accommodation shortfalls persist."
            ],
            "Recommendations": [
                "Develop a Pan-Defence Skills Framework linking Regulars, Reserves, civilians, and contractors for critical skills (cyber, AI, engineering, medical).",
                "Harmonise Regular and Reserve training; recognise civilian qualifications (e.g., cyber certifications) for rapid mobilisation.",
                "Expand joint promotion boards; centralise career management; embed One Defence mindset.",
                "Improve quality of service life: allocate ‚â• ¬£7 bn for Forces housing this Parliament; boost pay/rewards; support wounded/Reserve personnel via VALOUR system."
            ]
        }
    },
    "5. Allies and Partners": {
        "Observations": [
            "No state can face today‚Äôs challenges alone‚ÄîNATO must come first.",
            "Alliance interoperability is not yet embedded in all plans or procurement."
        ],
        "Recommendations": [
            "By January 2026, produce interoperability roadmap for logistics, communications, training, and capability development.",
            "Create a multilateral capability plan within NATO: joint procurement, harmonised standards, mutual test/evaluation recognition.",
            "Deepen AUKUS, Five Eyes, and EU ties for industrial base expansion, tech sharing, joint exercises, and interoperability.",
            "Formalise a Global Relationships desk within MOD to steward partnerships and align strategic objectives."
        ]
    },
    "6. Home Defence and Resilience: A Whole-of-Society Approach": {
        "Observations": [
            "Homeland defence is no longer niche‚Äîsub-threshold attacks (espionage, cyber, information ops, sabotage) can inflict major harm below kinetic conflict.",
            "Existing resilience strategy focuses on pandemic/pandemic-scale events rather than warfighting contexts."
        ],
        "Recommendations": [
            "Adopt a whole-of-society model: Government, industry, local authorities, NGOs, and citizens share resilience roles.",
            "Harden CNI: power grids, ports, transport, digital networks; share threat intel with private operators.",
            "Refresh national resilience strategy (eg. Exercise Cygnus) to include mass casualties, displaced populations.",
            "Expand Cadet Forces by 30 % to 250,000 by 2030 for STEM, civic duty, and future Reserve/Regular pipeline.",
            "Launch National Resilience Campaign for public education on deterrence, escalation risks, and personal preparedness.",
            "Establish Civil Defence Reserve pilot to train volunteers (medical, comms, logistics) for wartime support roles."
        ]
    },
    "Reserves": {
        "Observations": [
            "Entire force now consists of Regulars, Active Reserves, Strategic Reserves, civilians, and contractors, but coordination remains weak.",
            "Reserve structures and specialist roles are under-publicised; training resources are constrained."
        ],
        "Recommendations": [
            "Simplify Reserve structures/types; publicise specialist roles (lawyers, engineers, cyber specialists); protect time/funding/equipment for training.",
            "Expand Active Reserves by 20 % when funding allows; reinvigorate Strategic Reserves through engagement, training, and communications.",
            "Launch Pan-Defence Skills Framework: link workforce planning across Regulars, Reserves, civilians; automate 20 % of back-office functions by July 2028; shift HQ back-office personnel into operational roles.",
            "Align Regular and Reserve training with shared civilian qualifications for rapid mobilisation; use advanced simulation and live-fire exercises; partner with NATO Allies for training facilities.",
            "Pass Defence Readiness Bill to grant powers for Reserve mobilisation; map Reservist locations/skills; mandate annual warfighting readiness reporting; involve private-sector infrastructure.",
            "Expand Cadet Forces by 30 % (to 250,000) by 2030 to develop STEM skills, foster Armed Forces understanding, and build Reserve/Regular pipeline."
        ]
    },
    "Intelligence": {
        "Observations": [
            "Defence Intelligence (DI) is 500 staff below 2019 levels and fragmented across DI, PJHQ J2, UKSF J2, and Service ISR units.",
            "Procurement remains slow; DI lacks unified structure for collection, analysis, targeting, and operations."
        ],
        "Recommendations": [
            "Create a unified Military Intelligence Services (MIS) enterprise under DI by consolidating DI, PJHQ J2, UKSF J2, and Service ISR.",
            "Publish a Defence Intelligence Charter by November 2025 to formalise DI‚Äôs priorities, collection/analysis standards, and next-gen sensors/data fabrics.",
            "Establish a single Defence Counter-Intelligence Unit within DI by November 2025, coordinating with UKIC, NATO, and Five Eyes to protect personnel and data.",
            "Grant DI pay/recruitment flexibilities on par with UKIC; participate in cross-Government national security workforce strategy; facilitate secondments with industry for AI, cyber, and emerging-tech expertise.",
            "Align DI with UKIC data standards, vetting, and secure data-sharing by November 2025, including intelligence handling in crisis/war."
