            "National security is now the Government’s top priority given Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and broader global instability.",
            "Defence and economic security are closely linked: instability abroad drives up energy costs and inflation at home."
        ],
        "Recommendations": [
            "Increase defence spending to 2.5 % of GDP by 2027.",
            "Set an ambition for 3 % of GDP in the next Parliament to reverse previous force reductions and underinvestment."
        ]
    },
    "Foreword from the Secretary of State": {
        "Observations": [
            "Threat environment evolving rapidly: war in Europe, daily cyber-attacks, and heightened nuclear risks.",
            "Since the last General Election, the Government has already announced the largest sustained defence spending increase since the Cold War and delivered the biggest pay rise for Service personnel in over 20 years."
        ],
        "Recommendations": [
            "Continue external, expert-led consultation on Defence reform (e.g., submissions, industry engagement, citizens’ panel).",
            "Monitor implementation of legislation like the Armed Forces Commissioner Bill to improve service life."
        ]
    },
    "Foreword from the Reviewers": {
        "Observations": [
            "Commissioned amidst Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and growing great-power competition.",
            "Emphasis on bolstering deterrence by rebuilding UK's warfighting readiness, achieved through increased procurement, integration and putting NATO first."
        ],
        "Recommendations": [
            "Procurement and innovation must proceed at “wartime pace.”",
            "Aim to transition to 2.5 % of GDP (2.6 % including UKIC) by 2027 and target 3 % in the 2030s."
        ]
    },
    "1. Introduction and Overview": {
        "Observations": [
            "<b>For the first time since the end of the Cold War, the UK confronts multiple, direct threats to its security, prosperity, and democratic values</b> amid deep global volatility, including plausible high-intensity peer conflict in Europe and a rise in sub-threshold (“grey-zone”) attacks such as espionage, cyber-attack, and information manipulation.",
            "<b>Deterrence now requires readiness to fight and win a full-scale, protracted, and costly conflict</b>, which in turn demands a pivot away from outdated manpower-and-platform metrics toward dynamic networks of crewed, uncrewed, and autonomous assets linked by shared data and digital foundations.",
            "<b>Maintaining endurance in long campaigns hinges on assured access to critical capabilities underwritten by a resilient, scalable defence industrial base</b>, while a renewed emphasis on home defence and whole-of-society resilience is imperative to safeguard the homeland and critical national infrastructure.",
            "<b>This Strategic Defence Review delivers that root-and-branch response—externally led, costed to rise to 2.5 % of GDP (2.6 % including UKIC) by 2027 and 3 % in the 2030s—and sets out a clear vision for UK Defence through to 2035 across strategic context, roles, warfighting transformation, alliances, home defence, and integrated force capabilities</b>."
        ],
        "Recommendations": [
            "<b>Build and field an Integrated Force</b> under a single command structure (CDS/MSHQ) with a digital “targeting web” by 2027 and a dedicated Digital Warfighters group.",
            "<b>Innovate at wartime pace</b> via two new organisations (Defence Research & Evaluation and UK Defence Innovation with ≥ £400 m p.a.) and a Defence Investors’ Advisory Group.",
            "<b>Reform procurement</b> through segmented contracting timelines (major platforms in 2 yrs; spiral upgrades in 1 yr; rapid commercial buys in 3 months), risk-and-productivity incentives, and export mainstreaming.",
            "<b>Strengthen people and culture</b> by maintaining or growing Regulars, expanding Reserves by 20 %, automating 20 % of back-office functions by July 2028, and overhauling training with virtual, civilian-accredited environments.",
            "<b>Deepen alliances</b> with a NATO-First mindset across bilateral, minilateral (JEF, E3, E5), AUKUS, Global Combat Air, and sustained Ukraine support.",
            "<b>Enhance home defence</b> by growing Cadet Forces by 30 % by 2030, forging a “new deal” for CNI protection with private and allied partners, and legislating a Defence Readiness Bill for rapid mobilisation.",
            "<b>Equip a force fit for the 21st century</b> by sustaining the nuclear deterrent, accelerating AI and autonomy with a Uncrewed Systems Centre by February 2026, and bolstering space and CyberEM domains with dedicated commands.",
            "<b>Rebuild foundational capabilities</b>—empowering Defence Intelligence with a new charter, rebuilding Defence Medical Services, recapitalising the strategic base by February 2026, and ensuring “always-on” munitions production supported by joint enablers."

    "2. The Case for Transformation": {
        "Observations": [
            "There is a “new era of threat”: multipolar competition, rapid tech change, and daily sub-threshold attacks on the UK (espionage, cyber, economic coercion).",
            "Cold War–era posture and expeditionary-only approach no longer sufficient."
        ],
        "Recommendations": [
            "Fundamental transformation driven by Defence Reform, integrated force design, digital foundations, and joint innovation cycles.",
            "Position the UK as a tech-enabled power with an Integrated Force that deters, fights, and wins through constant “wartime pace” innovation."
        ]
    },
    "3. Roles for UK Defence": {
        "Observations": [
            "Primary role of Armed Forces: deterrence so war is unnecessary; if deterrence fails, be prepared to fight and win.",
            "Reliance on expeditionary disruption has masked the need for home defence and credible retaliation across all domains."
        ],
        "Recommendations": [
            "Build societal resilience to withstand and recover from attacks on critical national infrastructure (CNI).",
            "Develop expanded options for retaliation: conventional, cyber, economic, informational.",
            "Nurture strategic culture and education around nuclear escalation via wargames and tabletop exercises.",
            "Strengthen intellectual base and debate: ties with academia, think tanks, and industry.",

        "4.1 The Integrated Force Model": {
            "Observations": [
                "Joint operations are no longer enough; forces must be integrated from the top down under CDS at <abbr title='Military Strategic Headquarters'>MSHQ</abbr>.",
                "Integrated Force requires a single force design blending nuclear, conventional, and Special Forces, with common enablers delivered under one scheme."
            ],
            "Recommendations": [
                "Invert authority so design/readiness flows top-down rather than through Service stovepipes.",
                "Prioritise networked, software-defined capabilities (crewed/uncrewed, manned/unmanned teaming, AI).",
                "Build a common digital foundation and Digital Targeting Web for faster decision-making and distributed lethality.",
                "Interim: consolidate “Understand” and “Strike” at Cabinet sub-committee; create CyberEM Command by end 2025; empower Defence Intelligence under a new charter; sprint review to rebuild medical services; deliver Defence Infrastructure Recapitalisation Plan by Feb 2026."
            ]

                "2023/24 MOD R&D spend was £2.6 bn—needs alignment with <abbr title='Department for Science, Innovation and Technology'>DSIT</abbr>, UKRI, ARIA, and private sector."
            ],
            "Recommendations": [
                "Unlock private capital via funding models and regional clusters (e.g., cyber in Manchester, AI in Northeast, marine autonomy in Plymouth).",
                "Radical procurement reform: delegate authority to National Armaments Director Group, adopt an always-on munitions pipeline, embed UK export objectives.",
                "Create Defence Industrial Strategy co-chaired by Defence Secretary and Chancellor, plus a Defence Growth Board.",
                "Transfer UK Defence & Security Exports to MOD; establish export licensing review; embed metrics for lethality, productivity, and economic impact."

        "4.3 ‘One Defence’: People, Training, and Education": {
            "Observations": [
                "People are a critical enabler: recruitment, retention, and training must support an Integrated Force.",
                "Existing training pipelines are siloed, and accommodation shortfalls persist."
            ],
            "Recommendations": [
                "Develop a Pan-Defence Skills Framework linking Regulars, Reserves, civilians, and contractors for critical skills (cyber, AI, engineering, medical).",
                "Harmonise Regular and Reserve training; recognise civilian qualifications (e.g., cyber certifications) for rapid mobilisation.",
                "Expand joint promotion boards; centralise career management; embed One Defence mindset.",
                "Improve quality of service life: allocate ≥ £7 bn for Forces housing this Parliament; boost pay/rewards; support wounded/Reserve personnel via <abbr title='Veterans and Armed Forces Units of Readiness'>VALOUR</abbr> system."

            "Alliance interoperability is not yet embedded in all plans or procurement."
        ],
        "Recommendations": [
            "By January 2026, produce interoperability roadmap for logistics, communications, training, and capability development.",
            "Create a multilateral capability plan within NATO: joint procurement, harmonised standards, mutual test/evaluation recognition.",
            "Deepen AUKUS, Five Eyes, and EU ties for industrial base expansion, tech sharing, joint exercises, and interoperability.",

    },
    "6. Home Defence and Resilience: A Whole-of-Society Approach": {
        "Observations": [
            "Homeland defence is no longer niche—sub-threshold attacks (espionage, cyber, information ops, sabotage) can inflict major harm below kinetic conflict.",
            "Existing resilience strategy focuses on pandemic/pandemic-scale events rather than warfighting contexts."
        ],
        "Recommendations": [
            "Adopt a whole-of-society model: Government, industry, local authorities, NGOs, and citizens share resilience roles.",
            "Harden CNI: power grids, ports, transport, digital networks; share threat intel with private operators.",
            "Refresh national resilience strategy (e.g., <abbr title='Exercise Cygnus'>Exercise Cygnus</abbr>) to include mass casualties, displaced populations.",
            "Expand Cadet Forces by 30 % to 250,000 by 2030 for STEM, civic duty, and future Reserve/Regular pipeline.",

        ],
        "Recommendations": [
            "Simplify Reserve structures/types; publicise specialist roles (lawyers, engineers, cyber specialists); protect time/funding/equipment for training.",
            "Expand Active Reserves by 20 % when funding allows; reinvigorate Strategic Reserves through engagement, training, and communications.",
            "Launch Pan-Defence Skills Framework: link workforce planning across Regulars, Reserves, civilians; automate 20 % of back-office functions by July 2028; shift HQ back-office personnel into operational roles.",
            "Align Regular and Reserve training with shared civilian qualifications for rapid mobilisation; use advanced simulation and live-fire exercises; partner with NATO Allies for training facilities.",
            "Pass Defence Readiness Bill to grant powers for Reserve mobilisation; map Reservist locations/skills; mandate annual warfighting readiness reporting; involve private-sector infrastructure.",
